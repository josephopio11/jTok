# Simple TikTok Downloader

Clone the script using the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/josephopio11/jTok.git
```

Install all required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After the installation has finished, open the `main.py` file and set `download_url` variable to the web address of the
TikTok video.

The video will be downloaded into the folder having the same folder as the `main.py` file.

## Future Plans on this script

I will convert this to a simple GUI app with a field to enter the URL of the video, that will then be downloaded in the
background.

Hope it becomes a big project.
